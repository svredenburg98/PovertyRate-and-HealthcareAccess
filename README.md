# d3-challenge

In this challenge, I created a scatter plot to display the poverty rate and access to healthcare for populations in each state in the US.

I created the chart dimensions, appended the chart to the html chart element, imported the data and added the data for poverty and healthcare to the scatterplot. I then created a mouseover tooltip to display the healthcare and poverty values when a user hovers over the point with their mouse.

The chart showed a positive coorelation between the poverty rate and poor access to healthcare.
